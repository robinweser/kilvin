# Kilvin

Kilvin is a set of universal & primtivie Layout Components for [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/).<br>
It is build with [Fela](https://github.com/rofrischmann/fela/) and requires a working [react-fela](https://github.com/rofrischmann/fela/tree/master/packages/react-fela) setup. It is intended to be used in projects that use [Fela](https://github.com/rofrischmann/fela/) anyways.

Each Component is carefully crafted and well tested in production.
